    <h2>Alzheimer's Family History Risk Across Age Groups</h2>
    <p>This interactive dual-panel visualization examines the relationship between age, family history, and Alzheimer's disease prevalence. The left panel displays a bar chart showing the percentage of people diagnosed with Alzheimer's across six age groups (40-49, 50-59, 60-69, 70-79, 80-89, and 90+), with each bar representing the diagnosis rate for that cohort. The right panel features a horizontal stacked bar chart illustrating the distribution of Alzheimer's diagnoses based on family history (yes/no) for a user-selected age group. The visualization includes an interactive dropdown menu that allows users to filter the family history data for specific age cohorts, enabling targeted analysis of how hereditary factors might influence Alzheimer's risk at different life stages. Color coding remains consistent throughout, with blue representing individuals without Alzheimer's and orange indicating those with a diagnosis.</p>

    <h3>Interpretation</h3>
    <p>TThis visualization reveals compelling patterns in Alzheimer's disease prevalence across the lifespan. The left panel demonstrates a striking age-related progression in diagnosis rates, with incidence more than quadrupling from 15% in the 50-59 age group to 65% among those 80 and older. The steepest increase occurs between the 60-69 cohort (23%) and the 70-79 cohort (47%), suggesting this decade represents a critical window where risk accelerates dramatically.
The right panel provides crucial insight into the impact of family history on Alzheimer's risk. Across all age selections, individuals with a family history of Alzheimer's consistently show a higher proportion of diagnoses compared to those without such history. This relationship appears particularly pronounced in the older age groups, where genetic predisposition combined with advanced age creates a substantially elevated risk profile. The interactive age group selector reveals how this familial influence evolves across the lifespan, with the effect becoming more pronounced in later decades.
When considered together, these charts highlight the multifactorial nature of Alzheimer's risk, demonstrating that while age remains the strongest predictor, genetic factors significantly modify that risk throughout the aging process. This underscores the importance of comprehensive risk assessment that considers both age and family history when developing screening protocols and early intervention strategies. Furthermore, these patterns suggest that preventive approaches may be most effective when initiated earlier in life, particularly for those with known genetic predisposition.</p>
