        <h2>Conclusions</h2>
        <p>Using a comprehensive dataset and interactive visualizations, we explored Alzheimer's prevalence and risk factors across North America. Here are our key takeaways from each visualization:</p>

        <h3>1. Geographic Disparities in Diagnosis</h3>
        <p>Our choropleth map shows the U.S. and Mexico have higher diagnosis rates than many other countries. These differences may reflect variations in healthcare access, awareness, age demographics, and genetic predispositions.</p>

        <h3>2. Risk Rises Significantly with Age</h3>
        <p>Visualization 2 shows a clear age-related trend. Diagnosis rates increase sharply between ages 70 and 90, reinforcing the need for early intervention and screening in older populations.</p>

        <h3>3. Lifestyle and Behavioral Factors Matter</h3>
        <p>Our categorical analysis reveals that individuals with poor sleep, high stress, low social engagement, and poor diet exhibit significantly higher diagnosis rates. These modifiable factors suggest pathways for targeted prevention programs.</p>

        <h3>4. Risk Factors Are Prevalent Across All Countries</h3>
        <p>Visualization 4 compares genetic, metabolic, and hereditary risk factors by country. Family history and hypertension are the most prevalent across North America, particularly in Mexico, indicating consistent vulnerability across borders.</p>

        <h3>5. Family History and Age Act Synergistically</h3>
        <p>Visualization 5 highlights how Alzheimer’s risk quadruples from age 50 to 80+, especially for those with a family history. This interaction between age and genetics underscores the importance of early, personalized screening strategies.</p>

        <h3>Suggestions for Future Work</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Incorporate longitudinal tracking to examine risk progression over time.</li>
            <li>Include more granular socioeconomic and geographic data to explore intersectional disparities.</li>
            <li>Utilize predictive modeling and clustering to identify at-risk populations for early outreach.</li>
        </ul>
